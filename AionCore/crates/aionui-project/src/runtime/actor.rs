//! Shard — a sequential worker owning one canonical-hash slice of the runtime.
//!
//! Concurrency model (see `formal/runtime/runtime.md`): WS handlers, watcher
//! callbacks, the grace reaper, and disconnects all touch the tree + registry.
//! Rather than locking, a shard is a **sequential worker** (a task draining an
//! mpsc command queue) that exclusively owns its `Node`s, the `reverse`
//! subscriber index, watch registration, and grace/reaper. Same-canonical
//! mount/apply/unmount are serial for free; fan-out reads local state; cross-
//! shard work runs in parallel. Desktop uses **N = 1** (a single shard, all
//! serial — simplest). `forward` (session → canonicals) is global; this stage-0
//! core models one shard.
//!
//! [`Shard::handle`] is the whole decision core — the spawned worker is just a
//! loop over it — so command sequences unit-test every lifecycle and edge-race
//! guard deterministically, with no real tasks, timers, or channel races.
