//! A child that leaves the process group must still be torn down.
//!
//! Measured motivation (agy 1.1.9): its tool subprocesses each become their own
//! process-group leader, so the group SIGKILL that removes the CLI leaves the
//! tool running, reparented to init. A `cargo build` or dev server started by a
//! cancelled turn then had nothing left to stop it.

/// Reproduce the measured agy shape: an outer process in its own group, whose
/// child puts ITSELF in a different group and so survives a group kill.
///
/// The child must put ITSELF in a new session; inheriting the outer's group
/// would let the plain group kill reach it and the test would pass while
/// proving nothing. The pgids are asserted to differ for exactly that reason.
///
/// `set -m` was tried first and is NOT portable: on Linux `/bin/sh` is
/// typically dash, whose background jobs stay in the caller's process group,
/// so the fixture silently stopped escaping and the guard assertion caught it
/// on CI. `setsid(1)` exists on Linux but not macOS, and perl's `POSIX::setsid`
/// covers macOS — so whichever is present is used, and the guard still decides
/// whether the fixture is worth anything.
