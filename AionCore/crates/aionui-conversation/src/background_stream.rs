//! Out-of-turn stream delivery for direct-CLI (Session) conversations.
//!
//! The per-turn [`StreamRelay`] breaks at the turn's Finish — but a claude
//! session keeps talking after that:
//!
//! - **CLI-initiated turns.** When a background task (bash / Task subagent /
//!   workflow) completes, the CLI starts an UNPROMPTED turn to report the result
//!   (live 2026-08-03: BackendBound → tool check → MessageDelta ~30s after the
//!   launch turn ended). With only per-turn relays, that entire report was
//!   dropped: no WebSocket frames, no DB rows — the conversation looked dead.
//! - **Progress-card refreshes.** A background task's card ticks and settles
//!   between turns. Un-persisted settles left the stored row `running` forever,
//!   so the View Steps spinner never stopped after a reload.
//!
//! One watcher per live Session instance closes both gaps. It subscribes to the
//! instance's broadcast channel permanently and acts ONLY while no user turn is
//! active (the per-turn relay owns everything else):
//!
//! - `WorkflowProgress` → forwarded + persisted inline (a card refresh is not a
//!   turn).
//! - Turn content (text / thinking / tool calls / permissions…) → an **orphan
//!   turn**: a standard [`StreamRelay`] with freshly minted msg/turn ids, fed
//!   until the unprompted turn's own Finish. Full parity — segments,
//!   persistence, `turn.completed` — because it IS the normal relay.
