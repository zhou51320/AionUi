//! Sidebar read-model store: thin classification rows + batch hydration.
//!
//! The sidebar renders the whole left panel from one read snapshot. To stay
//! cheap at 10k–50k conversations this store returns *thin* rows (just the
//! fields the service needs to classify and order — no message/model blobs),
//! and hydrates only the windowed items via a single `IN (...)` batch. See
//! `api-contract-sidebar.md` §5.1 (single read transaction, no N+1).
//!
//! Base filter (conversations): the [`ArchiveScope`] `archived_at` predicate +
//! the shared health-check keep-fragment (BR-23, `$.is_health_check` in
//! `extra`). The marker is legacy and has no writer anywhere in the workspace
//! today, so the predicate is a defensive no-op — but it is applied identically
//! by the thin listing and by hydration so the口径 cannot drift if a writer ever
//! appears. Teams have no probe rows, so their thin listing filters
//! `archived_at` only.
