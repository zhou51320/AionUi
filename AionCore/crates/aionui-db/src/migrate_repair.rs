//! Idempotent pre-migration repair for migration 030 (`user_scope`).
//!
//! Migration 030 asserts several data-integrity invariants via fail-hard
//! `CHECK (ok = 1)` temp tables. Historical local databases can carry benign
//! inconsistencies (orphan child rows, duplicate identities) that older
//! versions tolerated; those trip the assertions and abort startup with
//! SQLite error 275, permanently blocking the app (Sentry ELECTRON-31Z /
//! ELECTRON-31X).
//!
//! We cannot rewrite the shipped 030 (sqlx checksum / VersionMismatch) and a
//! forward catch-up migration cannot run (the migrator stops at the first
//! failing migration), so we normalize the raw database to satisfy 030's
//! invariants *before* the migrator runs 030 — reusing the migrator's
//! connection and the caller's cross-process startup lock.
