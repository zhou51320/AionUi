//! 007 §C1 frozen seam types — the a-side vocabulary the conversation layer
//! sends DOWN (`Command`) and the orchestration types that flow back UP
//! (`SessionEnvelope`, `StateSnapshot`). These are the NEW symmetric
//! actor-mailbox seam (replacing 002's transport-leaking `BackendAdapter` over
//! the strangler migration, §8). All field-level frozen — 02-impl may not
//! change shapes without re-approval (C.9).
//!
//! NOTE (strangler): the legacy `command::Command` (2-variant) + `adapter`
//! module still drive `session::run_turn`. This module is the new path; the
