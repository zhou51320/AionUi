//! 007 §C1 the symmetric actor-mailbox backend seam (a-side). Two traits:
//! `BackendConnection` (connection-level: opens per-session handles) and
//! `SessionBackend` (per-session handle: `&self` dispatch + event stream +
//! capabilities). All transport is sealed inside impls; the only thing that
//! crosses the seam is `Command` down and `SessionEnvelope` up.
//!
//! This is the NEW seam (strangler, §8). The legacy `adapter::BackendAdapter`
//! still drives `session::run_turn` until codex (P1) forces the switch; both
//! compile in parallel.
