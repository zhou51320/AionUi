//! 007 §3 / C7: the `ConversationSession` — the conversation-side façade over
//! the seam. This is the SKELETON 007 ships (R14); the actual WIRING into
//! `aionui-conversation` (replacing `RuntimeCompletionPublisher` + the hardcoded
//! `turn.completed{canSendMessage}`) is the parallel conversation agent's P2
//! work. 007 freezes the contract here and proves the skeleton compiles + folds.
//!
//! ## What it is
//! A thin handle a conversation layer holds per logical session. It owns:
//!  - an `Arc<Orchestrator>` (the fold loop / broadcast fan-out),
//!  - an `Arc<dyn SessionBackend>` (the per-session transport handle; also the
//!    on-demand source of `Capabilities`),
//!  - a local `pending` queue (§9.11 — pending lives on the conversation side,
//!    the session never owns it; drained on `PromptAccepted{client_msg_id}`).
//!
//! ## What it is NOT (the frozen MUST-NOTs, §C7)
//! It NEVER calls `step()`, NEVER recomputes the unlock via `can_send_message`
//! (it reads `StateSnapshot.can_send`), NEVER mints `turn_gen`, NEVER blocks on a
//! dispatch return for turn completion, NEVER reaches into the adapter/transport.
//! It MAY ONLY: send Commands (threading `client_msg_id`), consume the demuxed
//! `SessionEnvelope` stream, drain pending on `PromptAccepted`, subscribe to the
//! read-only `StateSnapshot`/unlock streams, read `Capabilities` on demand (G4 —
//! pass-through to the backend so async discovery is reflected), and call
//! `reconnect()` on `Lagged`/transport drop.
