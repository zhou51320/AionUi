//! install has to be visible rather than failing in some unexplained way
//! mid-turn.
//!
//! claude and codex used to be exempt because the app bundled a version-pinned
//! copy of each. That hid a worse problem: the bundled CLI and the user's own
//! install could differ, so the same prompt behaved differently in AionUi and
//! in the user's terminal with nothing on screen explaining why. Bundling is
//! gone; this module gives all three backends the same treatment.
//!
//! Generic over the backend so the classification rules live in one place —
//! `antigravity::version` keeps its own module only for the agy-specific
//! notice copy.
