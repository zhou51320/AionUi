//! `AntigravityConnection` / `AntigravitySessionBackend` — the direct-CLI
//! backend for the `agy` CLI.
//!
//! Shape: ONE PROCESS PER TURN. Unlike the claude lane (a persistent process
//! fed through a retained stdin FIFO), agy has no `--input-format`, so a turn
//! is a complete `agy -p …` invocation that exits when the turn ends.
//! Continuity across turns comes from `--conversation <id>`, which agy resumes
//! from its own on-disk store; the id arrives in the `init` frame and is kept
//! as this session's resume anchor.
//!
//! Consequences of that shape:
//! - `open_session` spawns NOTHING. It only registers the session; the first
//!   process appears on the first `Send`.
//! - There is no mid-turn steering wire (agy ignores stdin once running —
//!   verified), so `supported_commands.steer` is false.
//! - `Cancel` kills the process; the turn's own `result` frame may never
//!   arrive, so the reader synthesizes the terminal event on exit.
